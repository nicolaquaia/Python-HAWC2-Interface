*** WARNING *** In mann module: Std scaling applied - other scalings bypassed. Instead of using std scaling, consider the right gamma factor in mann turb
*** WARNING *** The default advection direction of turbulence has been reversed in HAWC2 version 13.1.
The default advection direction complies with the Mann turbulence model, and turbulence boxes generated with HAWC2.
See the release notes for HAWC2 version 13.1 and the manual for more details.
